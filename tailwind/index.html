            <br> My name is Zied, and I am a passionate and driven 20-year-old with a strong interest in both game and
            web development. After graduating from the baccalaureate, I embarked on a journey to deepen my knowledge and
            skills in Unreal Engine,
            <br> where I focus on creating immersive and engaging video games. Alongside this, I am currently expanding
            my skill set by learning web development, which allows me to explore the world of building dynamic and
            user-friendly websites. This dual
            <br> focus on game and web development enables me to approach technology from a holistic perspective,
            developing a diverse range of skills that I can apply across multiple platforms.

            <br> My dedication to understanding the intricacies of game and web design drives me to constantly expand my
            knowledge, staying up to date with the latest technologies and trends in these fields. Beyond my academic
            and professional pursuits, I am deeply passionat
            <br> e about sports, especially football. The discipline, teamwork, and strategic thinking involved in
            football have shaped my approach to problem-solving, both in my studies and in my personal life. These
            experiences have also helped me develop essential skills
            <br> such as leadership, communication, and resilience, which I bring into my learning journey and
            professional aspirations.

            <br> As I continue to pursue my interests, I am focused on refining my technical expertise and contributing
            to the evolving world of game and web development. With a clear vision for the future, I am eager to combine
            my creativity, technical skills, and passion for
            <br> sports to create innovative solutions that can make a meaningful impact in the tech world.

                    <br> So far, I have learned how to use Tailwind to build responsive,
                    <br> utility-first web designs and customize components efficiently.
                    <br> I am gaining hands-on experience in styling modern web
                    <br> applications and creating flexible, scalable user interfaces.

            <p>Creating a small FPS game project in Unreal Engine 5 was a great hands-on
                <br> experience that helped me learn and understand game development fundamentals.
                <br> I started by setting up the project, exploring the engine’s interface, and
                <br> utilizing its advanced features like Nanite for high-quality assets and
                <br> Lumen for dynamic lighting. Implementing basic mechanics such as player
                <br> movement, shooting, and enemy AI was a challenging yet rewarding process.
                <br>I also experimented with Blueprints, which allowed me to quickly prototype and iterate. Overall,
                <br> this project enhanced my understanding of Unreal Engine's powerful tools and game development
                workflow.

            <p>In my projects using CSS, HTML, and Tailwind, I focused on building well-structured web pages with modern
                design principles. I started by working with HTML to create clear and semantic layouts, ensuring
                accessibility and good SEO practices. For styling, I initially used custom CSS to create the visual
                elements and make sure they looked good across different browsers.

                <br> As I started learning Tailwind CSS, I found its utility-first approach helpful
                <br> in speeding up my design process. While I'm still getting comfortable with it,
                <br> I've used Tailwind to quickly apply styles like margins, padding, and typography
                <br> without having to write custom CSS every time. Although I’m still improving my
                <br> skills with responsive design, I’ve begun experimenting with
                <br> Tailwind’s responsive classes to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
